### 1. Theory

Here's an iishanten theory.

Standard shanten is calculated by the formula `8 - 2*groups - min(taatsus/pairs, 4) - x` where `x=1` if you have a pair and at least five blocks and `x=0` otherwise. Therefore, you are iishanten if you have 3 groups and two taatsus, or if you have 2 groups and, and... hmm let me think

### 2. Detection

Here's an iishanten theory.

- Assume you're not tenpai.
- If you have two sets and at most one floating tile, you're iishanten.
- If you have three sets and at most two floating tiles, you're iishanten.
- Otherwise, you're not iishanten.
